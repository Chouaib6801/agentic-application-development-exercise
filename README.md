# Agentic Application Development Exercise

This is a **recruitment exercise** designed to evaluate your ability to build LLM-powered agentic applications under time constraints while making smart prioritization decisions.

## Important Notice

**This exercise is intentionally NOT completable in the allotted time.** We evaluate not only your technical skills but also your ability to:
- Prioritize features and functionality
- Make pragmatic trade-offs under time pressure
- Document what you've accomplished and what remains
- Structure your work so others can understand your thought process

## How This Works

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Make an initial commit** with the message: `"starting the exercise"`
3. **Work on the exercise** for a maximum of 2 hours
4. **Make a final commit** with the message: `"finishing the exercise"`
5. **Make frequent commits** during the exercise so evaluators can follow your thinking process

**Time Limit: 2 hours maximum.** Submissions not respecting this constraint will be discarded.

## What You Need to Build

Create an application that leverages LLM-powered agents with the following characteristics:

### Core Requirements

- **Multimodal Prompt Input**: The agent should accept multimodal prompts (text, images, etc.) as input
- **File Output**: The agent must be able to generate and output files
- **External Data Source**: Connect to external data (web search, third-party APIs, databases, etc.)
- **High Context Handling**: The application should handle workloads containing large amounts of context

### Technical Requirements

- **Queue System**: Long-running jobs should be executed asynchronously using a queue and worker pattern
- **Runnable**: Any developer should be able to easily run your project
  - Deliverables can be in any form (web UI, mobile app, terminal app, script, etc.) as long as they are easily runnable by the evaluator in any OS
- **Clear Documentation**: It must be obvious what your application does, even if incomplete
- **Credential Handling**: If credentials are required:
  - Ship them securely to the evaluator, OR
  - Provide precise documentation on how to obtain them

### Constraints

- All code and documentation must be in **English**
- The project must be easily runnable by evaluators
- You have **maximum 2 hours** from start to finish commit

## What We Evaluate

1. **Technical Skills**
   - Code quality and architecture
   - Understanding of agentic patterns
   - Integration of LLM capabilities
   - System design decisions

2. **Prioritization & Pragmatism**
   - Which features did you implement first?
   - What trade-offs did you make?
   - How did you handle the time constraint?

3. **Communication**
   - Code readability
   - Documentation clarity
   - Commit messages and history
   - Setup instructions

4. **Problem-Solving Approach**
   - Your git history shows how you think
   - How you break down complex problems
   - Your ability to deliver incrementally

## Suggestions

- Start with a minimal working version
- Document as you go
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- Focus on demonstrating understanding over perfect implementation
- If you don't finish (you won't!), document what you would do next
- Use any programming language, frameworks, and tools you're comfortable with

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Commit with message: `"starting the exercise"`
4. Start building!

**Remember: We know you can't finish everything. Show us how you prioritize and build under constraints.**

Good luck, and be creative!
